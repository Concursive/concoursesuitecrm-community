ASPCFS can make SSL socket connections in order to transfer data to other
systems using one of the following methods:

1. The server that ASPCFS is connecting to has a valid certificate that is
   signed by a certificate authority (VeriSign, Thawte, etc)
   
2. The server that ASPCFS is connecting to has a self-signed certificate
   and has been added to the ASPCFS keystore.

In order to accept self-signed certificates, ASPCFS has a default keystore
that public certificates can be added to.
   
To create a keystore, use the following command:

% keytool -genkey -alias aspcfs -keyalg RSA -keysize 1024 -dname CN=www.aspcfs.com -keystore keystore -keypass aspcfs -storepass aspcfs

The resulting keystore file should be placed in the ASPCFS WEB-INF folder.

When connecting to other systems, the peer system's key should be added to
the keystore:

% keytool -import -keystore keystore -alias unique_name -file file.cert
