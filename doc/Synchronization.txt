 *  Client/Server Synchronization (DRAFT)

This protocol requires that the server and each client are able to keep 
track of changes that have happened between synchronizations. 

To specify the changed data items, unique identifiers are used (GUID). The GUID 
will consist of the YEAR+MONTH+DAY+HOUR+MINUTE+SECOND+CLIENT_ID 
when the record is created.
** A systemId field will need to be added to each CFS table to identify
   the system that modified the record.  The server is systemId 0, then
   each client's pdaId is the client systemId.  This will prevent updates
   the client sends from being sent back.

To indicate the type of modification, different actions are specified within
a transaction.  Actions include: insert, update, and delete.

Sync anchors are used to enable sanity checks of synchronization. A sync anchor 
is a date/time when the last synchronization was completed, stored on both 
the client and server.  These must match for the systems to be in sync.

In this approach, the client drives the whole synchronization process.

Unanswered Questions:
- Should the client or server be responsible for specifying the order of 
  synchronization events?
- Will the client request the specific tables to be synchronized, or will the
  server use a map to control which tables are processed for changed data?
- Will all of the changes be rolled into a single transaction, or will they
  be sent in chunks?
  

The synchronization process:

---[ INITIATE DATA SYNCHRONIZATION ]---

Client #1 Prepares for Synchronization
- Client reads local Sync Anchor (Last Anchor)
- Client sends transaction and command in body
   <syncClient action="prepare">
     <anchor/>
   </syncClient>
  Initially the anchor is null, but will be a date/time in future syncs
- Server compares, if not a match then a previous synchronization error
  may have occurred, returns Slow Sync response
- Client generates new sync anchor (Next Anchor) in memory, to be saved later
- The Sync Anchor is the current date/time

---[ BEGIN CLIENT DATA SYNCHRONIZATION ]---
All changes can be requested and sent in a single transaction, or separated.  
The order in which tables are processed is important for referential data.

Client #1 Sends records for insert with GUID... one or all records
- Client sends transaction and command in body
- Server looks in mapping table, if GUID does not exist then continues
- Server inserts item into corresponding table
- Server inserts GUID, tableId, and recordId into client mapping table
   clientId | GUID | tableId | RecordId
- Server responds with success

Client #1 Sends records for update with GUID... one or all records
- Client sends transaction and command in body
- Server looks up ClientId and GUID to get RecordId to be updated
- Server sets the RecordId of the record
- Server updates the record
- Server responds with success

Client #1 Sends records for delete with GUID...
- Client sends transaction and command in body
- Server looks up ClientId and GUID to get RecordId to be deleted
- Server sets the RecordId of the record
- Server deletes the record
- Server deletes the ClientId/GUID record in client mapping table
- Server responds with success

---[ BEGIN SERVER DATA SYNCHRONIZATION ]---
All changes can be requested and sent in a single transaction, or separated.  
The order in which tables are processed is important for referential data.

Client #1 Requests new Inserts
- Client sends transaction and command in body
- Client sends Last Anchor and Next Anchor to server in transaction
- Server determines records to be inserted
   Criteria: Date entered after Last Anchor and before Next Anchor,
   and record is not in client mapping table
   ** This prevents records just inserted by this client
- Server sends record(s) to client with insert command
- Server inserts GUID into client mapping table (if not already there) 

Client #1 Requests new Updates
- Client sends transaction and command in body
- Client sends Last Anchor and Next Anchor to server in transaction
- Server determines records to be updated
   Criteria: Date modified after Last Anchor and date entered before Last Anchor,
   and date modified before Next Anchor, and systemId <> clientId
   ** This prevents records just updated by this client
- Server sends record(s) to client with update command

Client #1 Requests new Deletes
- Client sends transaction and command in body
- Client sends Last Anchor and Next Anchor to server in transaction
- Server determines records to be deleted
   Criteria: Records that can no longer be mapped in the client mapping table
- Server sends record(s) to client with delete command
- Server flags deleted items in client mapping table (to be cleaned up later)

---[ FINALIZE DATA SYNCHRONIZATION ]---

Client #1 Ends Synchronization
- Client sets Sync Anchor to Next Anchor in local System table
- Client updates Anchor on Server with Next Anchor command
- Server deletes records flagged in client mapping table since they should
  no longer be on the client
