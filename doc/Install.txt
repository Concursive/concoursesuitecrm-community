  # loads on startup.  You can log into the server and try accessing the

*** Creating an initial user account ***
  *** NOT IMPLEMENTED YET ***
  # Now that the database is installed, add a CFS user by executing the following
  # command, and answering the questions that appear:
    $ ant adduser
  *** NOT IMPLEMENTED YET ***

Temporary solution:
  # CFS is installed with a default user called 'dhvadmin' that is solely responsible
  # for inserting the default table data for referential integrity.  This account
  # is also used for creating a single new user that will be the administrator of the
  # system.
  
  # A password for this user can be changed by typing the following, change the word test of course:
  $ java -cp .:/home/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/aspcfs.jar org.aspcfs.utils.PasswordHash test
  
  # Now update the database with the encrypted password that was generated... 
  $ psql cdb_[company abbreviation] -c "UPDATE access SET password = '098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6' WHERE username = 'dhvadmin';
  
  # The dhvadmin user can be disabled by setting the password to any word, or even null, once done.
  
  
  
*** PostgreSQL Tuning ***

[root]

PostgreSQL by default is very conservative.  It's a good idea to increase a few
things on the system.

# Increase the kernel shared memory
# This is a calculation based on ACTUAL server memory!!!
# To check the current shared memory on a system, use:
    $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
# In this example, the server has 256MB so I want to increase shared memory to ~64MB
# 256Mb total, 64Mb shared, 12Mb sort
# 512Mb total, 128Mb shared, 12Mb sort
# 1Gb total, 256Mb shared, 32Mb sort

# The greater this number, the more PostgreSQL can load the database into memory
  $ vi /etc/sysctl.conf
  
  # Add the following line at the bottom:
    kernel.shmmax = 68403200

# To update the server at run-time, without rebooting:
  $ echo 68403200 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax

# Now modify postgresql configuration to use more memory
# This is a calculation based on the kernel shmmax!!!
  $ vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
  
  # Uncomment the following line and change the value:
  # shared buffers AT THE MOST can be (shmmax - 2867200) / 8192
    shared_buffers = 8000
  # Uncomment the following line and change the value:
  # sort_mem should not be too much, 512k is the default so try:
    sort_mem = 12288
    
# On an initial data load, set fsync=false, but turn it back on when done!!!
# This will speed up inserts but can cause data loss if the server fails

# PostgreSQL will need to be restarted after saving changes
  $ service postgresql restart
  

Vacuuming the database regularly is highly recommended to keep the indexes
up to date.

# In psql, try:
  # vacuum;

  
  
*** Tomcat Tuning ***

[root]
  
  # In /etc/profile change the amount of memory that Java uses
  # depending on the amount of memory the system has!!!!!!!
  # 256Mb total, use 128m
  # 512Mb total, use 256m
  # 1Gb total, use 512m
  $ vi /etc/profile
    export JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx128m -Xms128m
  
*** Software Maintenace ***

Even though the production server uses RAID, it is important that the database 
is remotely backed up, as well as the file library.  There are several ways to
handle this, the simplest being a download of the database that can be restored
to the same server or other servers fairly easily.

[user]

# Copy the postgres backup script
  $ cd ~/cfs2
  $ sudo cp cfs2/bin/postgres-backup.sh /var/lib/pgsql/
  $ sudo chown .postgres /var/lib/pgsql/postgres-backup.sh
  $ sudo chmod a+x /var/lib/pgsql/postgres-backup.sh

[root user]

# On this server make a cron entry to run postgres-backup.sh,
# the resulting backup will be in /home/backup/DB_BACKUP
  $ crontab -e
37 4 * * * su postgres -c "/var/lib/pgsql/postgres-backup.sh '' 127.0.0.1 all `date +%a`"

/* ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATION: Run on a remote server */

# This script could also be installed on another server,
# just change the domain name/ip and make sure that
# postgres allows the other server access to this server by
# updating pg_hba.conf and iptables
37 4 * * * su postgres -c "/var/lib/pgsql/postgres-backup.sh '' 127.0.0.1 all `date +%a`"

# If the postgres version is not the same on both servers,
# then here is a solution:
- On a remote server, install Postgresql from the RPMs
- Copy the postgres-backup.sh from the ASPCFS distribution into /var/lib/pgsql
- For the corresponding Postgresql version number, copy the following files into
  /var/lib/pgsql/ so that the backup is compatible with future versions of postgresql
  $ cp /usr/bin/pg_dump /var/lib/pgsql/pg_dump723
  $ cp /usr/bin/pg_dumpall /var/lib/pgsql/pg_dumpall723
  $ cp /usr/bin/psql /var/lib/pgsql/psql723
  
  # Change all instances of: 
  #  pg_dump to pg_dump723, 
  #  pg_dumpall to pg_dumpall723
  #  psql to psql723
  # in the following files:
  $ vi pg_dump723
  $ vi pg_dumpall723
  
- Then you need to setup a cron task with the following

# Backup all the remote datebases for a server, and keep a 7 day rolling backup
# The first parameter after backup.sh is the Postgresql version to backup from,
# 723 matches Postgresql 7.2.3
37 4 * * * su postgres -c "/var/lib/pgsql/postgres-backup.sh 723 aspcfs.darkhorseventures.com all `date +%a`"




*** System Failure Recovery ***

[root user]

# Postgres
  # If the server is reset without shutting down, PostgreSQL might fail to startup,
  # use the following command to reset the process id:
  $ rm /var/lib/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid
  $ service postgresql start
