There are several issues regarding the browser and the operating system the
browser runs on.

Supported and tested browsers:
- Internet Explorer 5.0 (Windows)
- Internet Explorer 5.5 (Windows)
- Internet Explorer 6.0 (Windows)
- Internet Explorer 5.2 4609 (Macintosh OSX)
- Internet Explorer 5.2.2 5010.1 (Macintosh OSX)
- Mozilla 1.2 (Windows/Linux/Macintosh)
- Mozilla 1.3 (Windows/Linux/Macintosh)
- Netscape 6 (Windows)
- Netscape 7 (Windows)

Issue #1: Fonts
- Depending on the OS, different fonts are available, it's important to provide
  several fonts for the browser to choose from in the HTML
- For CFS, 8pt looks the best for the amount of data that is displayed
- Up to Mozilla 1.2 on Linux, 10pt more closely matches 8pt on Windows
Solutions:
- Use font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif
- For everything except Mozilla < 1.3 use font-size: 8pt
  For Mozilla < 1.3 use font-size: 10pt
  An even easier solution is to just use 8pt fonts and let the user set
  a minimum, hopefully their browser will catch up

Issue #2: Cascading Style Sheets
- Although there are issues in what CSS version a browser supports, CFS
  keeps it simple and and supports the lowest-common-demoninator, which is
  currently IE 5.0

Issue #3: JavaScript
- Most browsers fall into either the IE version x camp (mainly IE) or the
  Netscape version x camp.
Solution:
- In JavaScript, a simple check can determine
  the browsers capability.
  IE 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 6
  NS 4, 6 (Includes Mozilla and variants)

Issue #4: In-line HTML editing
- This is an interesting feature in which a user can compose HTML within
  a web page
- Internet Explorer 5.5 introduced this feature
- Mozilla 1.3 now has its implementation available
- As of now, Netscape doesn't support this, but it will in a new release
Solution:
- In a web page that uses HTML editing, specify the specific supported
  browsers, else default to a simple TextArea
- If IE 5.5 or greater, implement it one way
- If Mozilla 1.3 or greater, implement it another way
- Else use a TextArea
