Some thoughts on the subject...

Minimize the database hits by getting a single list of opportunities to process.
Supporting objects may be too much.

When the user logs in, their hierarchy is in memory.
- getFullChildList() gets a vector of all users in hierarchy
- getShortChildList() gets a vector all all immediate users in hierarchy
- getChild(int userId) gets a UserRecord object from the user's hierarchy.
  getFullChildList() and getShortChildList() can then be called.
  
When the user goes to the Opportunities Dashboard the following events can
speed up the listing:
- Create a list of objects representing each term to be displayed on the chart.
  SummaryList contains Summary objects by term, in this case 12 months.
  Each Summary object is a vector of Element objects.
- Get the Hierarchies from memory.
- Get an OpportunitiesList matching the users in the hierarchy from the database
- Parse through the OpportunitiesList object, parsing each Opportunity into
  1 or more Element objects.  Each Element is then added to the
  appropriate Summary object in the SummaryList.addElement(Element, term).
  The Opportunity is then put into another OpportunityList so that the current
  selected user's opportunities can be displayed, if that Opportunity owner
  matches the currently selected user.
  
The resulting SummaryList contains all of the data required to build
any of the charts.  Store this object in the User's session, then
rebuild it only when necessary.  A timestamp in the session will be matched to
a system variable indicating when an update is necessary.  The final SummaryList
object doesn't have to get rebuilt each during drill downs since all the data
is available.

Objects:
OpportunityList
 -> Might have to requery list each time by Id or store all in session?
ReportingStaff
 -> Can get from user's Hierarchy
SummaryList vector contains Summary objects, 1 for each term to display
  - Methods to get a specific term and it's computed sum of data
 -> Each Summary object is a vector that contains Element objects
    - Name (Month Name, Quarter, or Year -- depending on terms)
    - Methods to get a specific calculation of the elements based on the user's
      selection.
  -> Each Element stores the data in a hashtable so this works in any
     charting section and for reports -- like the new Accounts graph
     - Owner Id, Probability, Amount, and Commission %, ? 

Usage:
The whole SummaryList is now available for parsing through the records and 
creating the appropriate chart by the module.
