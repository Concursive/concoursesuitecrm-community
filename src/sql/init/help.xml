<briefDescription>This is the &quot;Home Page&quot;. The top set of tabs shows the individual modules that you can access. The second row are the functions available to you in this module.
If you are looking for a particular module or function you have seen during training or on someone else&apos;s machine, and it&apos;s NOT visible, then it probably means that you do not have permission for that module or function.

Permissions within the system are assigned to Roles and then Users are assigned to Roles by the System Administrator.
</briefDescription>
<detailDescription>The Home Page has several main features.

Welcome: This is the welcome page. Here you will see a calendar of all of your upcoming alerts in the system, as well as for users that report to you.

Mailbox: The message system is designed to support INTERNAL business messaging needs and to prepare OUTGOING emails to addresses who are already in the system. Messaging is NOT a normal email replacement. It will not send email to addresses assigned &quot;on-the-fly&quot; and it will not receive OUTSIDE email.

Tasks: Tasks allows you to create and assign tasks. Tasks created can be assigned to the creator of the task or an employee working in the system. This page lists the tasks present along with their priorities, due dates and age.

Action Lists: Action Lists allow you to create a list of contacts that are related in some way. For each of the contacts in a list, you can add calls, opportunities, tickets, tasks or send a message, which would correspondingly show up in their respective tabs. For example, adding a ticket to the contact would be reflected in the Ticket module.

Re-assignments: You can reassign data from one employee to another employee as long as each employee reports to you. The data can be of different types related to accounts, contacts, opportunities, activities, tickets etc, which the newly reassigned employee could view.

Settings: This feature allows you to modify the information about yourself and your location, and also change your password to the system.</detailDescription>

<briefDescription>Pipeline helps in creating opportunities or leads in the company. Each opportunity helps to follow-up on a lead, which might eventually turn into a client. Here you can create an opportunity, search for an existing opportunity in the system, or export the data in different formats. The dashboard displays a progress chart in different views for all the employees working under the hierarchy of the owner of the opportunity.
</briefDescription>
<detailDescription>This Pipeline System has four main features:

Dashboard: Gives you a quick, visual overview of opportunities.

Add: This page lets you add an opportunity into the system. Here a new opportunity can be added by giving the description of the opportunity. You can add a component that is associated with the opportunity. Each component can be assigned to an employee and the type of the component can be selected. For each component the probability of closing the component, the date estimated, the best guess for closing the deal and the duration for that component can be entered.

Search: You can search for an opportunity already existing in the system based on different filters.

Export: The data can be filtered, exported and displayed in different formats.</detailDescription>
